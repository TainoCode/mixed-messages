# mixed-messages
Mixed Messages is the first Codecademy portfolio project for the Fullstack Career Path Certification. For this particular program I decided to go with a funny random title generator. Be it for project names, music bands, company names, etc. so I hope it gets a good ol' guffaw out of you!

## Project Objectives
- Build a message generator program using Javascript
- Use Git version control
- Use the command line
- Develop locally on your computer

### Prerequisites
- Javascript
- Node.js
- Git and GitHub
- Command Line

### How to Use
To use this simple script and start generating your random titles do the following:
1. Ensure you have Node.js installed in your system
2. Download the repo or clone the repo
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory that contains the project files
4. Run command `node generator.js` and enjoy!
